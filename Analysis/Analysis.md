# Analysis Performed on several genomic files

## ArchTEx
Architectural Tag Extender - identifies the average length of the DNA fragments that were sequenced using cross-correlation of single-read sequencing. 

Ran ArchTEx on all MNase-seq experiment results to determine which is the most appropriate for analysis.
