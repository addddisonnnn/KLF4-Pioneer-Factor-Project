These were all the files that were compiled together and information on what the cell line was originally, if KLF4 was introduced, and when it was harvested

HUMAN
1. BJ_1.bed BJ_2.bed BJ_3.bed BJ_4.bed  
- Originally fibroblast cells that were transdifferenitated into an unspecified epithelial cell type.
- KLF4 was already expressed
- Harvested after 5 minutes of being crosslinked with formaldehyde at room temperature and quenched.
b. BJ_5.bed 
- Originally fibroblast cells that were reprogrammed into iPSCs.
- KLF4 was expressed by introducing doxycycline
- Harvested after 48 hours of induction but before full reprogramming
2. H9_ESC.bed 
- Never changed
- KLF4 already expressed
- Harvested after being subjected to heat shock conditions (42Â°C)
3. iPSC.bed (7 day fibro induced)
- Originally somatic cell (not stated what type) and turned into iPSC
- Cells were infected with lentiviruses encoding for dox-inducible Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc
- 7 days harvest (not fully differentiated)
4. LIS49_hESC.bed 
- Never changed
- KLF4 already expressed
5. MCF7_1.bed 
- Never changed
- KLF4 already expressed
- Harvested after growing in DMEM culture under normal conditions
b. MCF7_2.bed MCF7_3.bed 
- Never changed
- KLF4 was introduced by a protein encoding KLF4 being fused with eGFP (a fluorescent tag) being introduced into the MCF-7 cells
- Harvested after the stable cell line expressing eGFP-KLF4 was established
6. U87.bed (glioblastoma)
- Never changed
- Induced cell line doxy
7. HN_SCC.bed
- Never changed
- KLF4 already expressed


MOUSE
1. Bone_marrow.bed
- Never changed 
- KLF4 was inactivated to study the effects of it turned off
2. CD19.bed
- Originally B cells obtained from bone marrow and reprogrammed to iPSC
- KLF4 was introduced when doxycycline was added for reprogramming
- Harvested wo days after induction of OKSM
